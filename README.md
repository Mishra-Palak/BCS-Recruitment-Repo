* About NN:
Neural network concepts are inspired by how our brain works. We can visualize an NN as a collection of connected nodes (Reminds me of graphs in DSA). These nodes are connected by weights, which are the parameters that transform input data within the network's hidden layers. Activation function defines how the weighted sum of the input nodes is transformed to the next layer. Neural networks have got a great use in performing machine learning tasks.
